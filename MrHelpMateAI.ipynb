    "#### Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI framework for improving the quality of LLM-generated responses by grounding the model on external sources of knowledge to supplement the LLM’s internal representation of information. Implementing RAG in an LLM-based question answering system has two main benefits: It ensures that the model has access to the most current, reliable facts, and that users have access to the model’s sources, ensuring that its claims can be checked for accuracy and ultimately trusted.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",

    "The goal of the project is to build a robust generative search system capable of effectively and accurately answering questions from a policy document using the RAG framework described above\n",
