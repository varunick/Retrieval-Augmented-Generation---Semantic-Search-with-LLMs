    "#### Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI framework for improving the quality of LLM-generated responses by grounding the model on external sources of knowledge to supplement the LLMâ€™s internal representation of information. Implementing RAG in an LLM-based question answering system has two main benefits: It ensures that the model has access to the most current, reliable facts, and that users have access to the modelâ€™s sources, ensuring that its claims can be checked for accuracy and ultimately trusted.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
